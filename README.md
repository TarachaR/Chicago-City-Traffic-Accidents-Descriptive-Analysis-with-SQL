## Understanding The Context

With this project, I'm trying to understand car crashes in the city of Chicago based on only the dataset findings, I'm are required to make recommendations to the office of the mayor of Chicago, on the steps to take that would lead to a reduction in car crashes.

## Project Deliverable
Deliverable is a python notebook that contains my solution: Chicago City Traffic Accidents.ipynb

Dataset name: traffic_accidents.csv

As part of my descriptive analysis report, I decided to find answers to the following questions using SQL:

1. Display a list of 5 makes that had the highest number of crashes?
2. Most personal vehicles involved in crashes were travelling towards which direction? 
3. How many passengers were involved in personal cars were in accidents?
4. How many passengers were involved in accidents while travelling in personal Sport Utility vehicles?
5. Compute the total number of Mercedez-Benz vehicles involved in accidents while being parked.
6. Compute the total occupant count per vehicle count.
7. Sort the number of passengers in descending order by travel direction taking into account travel direction. Return travel direction and no. of passengers.
8. Select top 5 vehicle models involved in the accident with no defect, order them by make and show their manoeuvre. 
9. Which ridesharing vehicles in an accident had the most number of passengers? Return model, and no of passengers.

## Recommendations
- TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY, LTD. should revisit their rigourous vehicle inspection policies in order to detect any defects which in turn would greatly reduce the number of accidents caused by vehicle defects.
- All roads leadding to the South should be inspected for any hazards that may lead to road accidents.
- The ridesharing service providing its services with the vehicle model MKZ should delve more into and review its policies which may help shed more light as to why they have the most number of passengers involved in accidents.
